"In fact, let us just call things what they are. When a man's love of finery clouds his moral judgement, that is vanity. When he lets a demanding palate make his moral choices, that is gluttony. When he ascribes the divine will to his own whims, that is pride. And when he gets angry at being reminded of animal suffering that his own daily choices might help him avoid, that is moral cowardice"(Dominion, 121).

"Take one impulse, your hankering for a hot dog. Multiply it a hundred million times over and follow the lines as they meet in Utah at that 50,000-acre facility, housing all those hogs never once allowed outside. That is the complex world one craving creates. Most people can't even face the details behind it" (Dominion, 44).

"Missing above all is love, which the theorists mistake for utility. Love for animals, like our own love for one another, comes in seeing the worth and beauty of other apart from us, in understanding that the creatures need not be our equals to be our humble brothers in suffering and sadness and the story of life" (Dominion, 246).

“Farmers love their animals and want only the best for them, while still profiting from sending them to a slaughterhouse to be killed. It is undeniably a contradiction to claim to love someone who you intend to kill for money.” – Ed Winters

“Who are we to say dogs and cats have more rights than cows and pigs. They’re all conscious. They feel the same. They hurt the same. God help us understand!” – Izey Victoria

Russell Brand

Marie Sarantakis

“There is no fundamental difference between humans and animals in their ability to feel pleasure and pain, happiness, and misery.”
Charles Darwin

"In 1971 the psychologist Herbert
A. Simon presciently wrote, “The wealth of information means a dearth of
something else . . . a poverty of attention.” Researchers tell us attention and
focus are the raw materials of human creativity and flourishing. In the age
of increased automation, the most sought-after jobs are those that require
creative problem-solving, novel solutions, and the kind of human ingenuity
that comes from focusing deeply on the task at hand." -- go on about my good focusing if I have it, in Website
