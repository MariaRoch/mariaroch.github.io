    <h1>Introduction #1</h1>
    <h4>"The Basics" - Education, Career, Interests</h4>
    <hr>

    <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
    <p>I am an experienced Math Tutor. I am also a Florida Tech alumnus in Applied Mathematics, with an Applied Area of Computer Science!</p>
    <p>Actually, let me start from the beginning:</p>

    <p>I was Homeschooled, and I started at Indian River State College (IRSC) at 14 years old. I had a perfect GPA most of my time there, and I started tutoring Calculus (among other maths) there when I was 17. I worked in the Math Lab primarily, but also in classrooms and the Academic Support Center (ASC). I became the president of Delta Mu Epsilon (Math Club). Upon graduating high school, I received my AA in Mathematics from IRSC, with a 3.97 GPA! Because of these things (and my SAT superscore of 1500/1600), I was placed on the 2019 All-Florida Academic Team (which is the top 0.02% of students enrolled in 2 year colleges in Florida).</p>

    <p>I was very blessed to have received merit-based, full-ride offers (100% of tuition paid) from multiple universities, including the Florida Institute of Technology, which I decided to attend. During my time there, I was involved in FITSEC (Cybersecurity Club), CPFIT (Competitive Programming Club), and lightly involved in AMS (American Mathematical Society). In December 2023, I received my BS in Applied Mathematics (Applied Area: Computer Science) from FIT, with a 3.68 GPA!</p>

    <p>The Summer before I graduated, I was chosen for a competitive internship at none other than Royal Caribbean Group! The internship's focus was using Data Analysis on Cybersecurity trends within the organization. I gained valuable hands-on experience in Power BI, Excel, and Python.</p>

    <p>Since completing my BS at FIT, I have returned to be a Math Tutor again at IRSC! I love IRSC so much, I came back to work here a 2nd time, haha! I absolutely love immersing myself in an environment of learning and growth. I also am quite lucky to have such kind colleagues/bosses, in a place where we all have each other's backs. I often hang out there after I work; it is that much of an enjoyable place to be, and I'm happy to be celebrating one year here (again)!</p>

    <!-- <p>A side note: I'm not working part-time because I can't get a full-time job or something, but rather, my health has been subpar, and I highly enjoy tutoring. I find it very fulfilling to be of assistance to others in something that I'm good at, and I also have loved getting to know my many awesome colleagues! I'm not in a dire financial situation, so I haven't had to meet X career goal by Y time. I actually tend to get interviews easily. I have been able to quite literally handpick an organization to get hired for before (at least once), and I've been hired on the spot at the end of interviews (multiple times). I've also had to make the hard decision of turning down an interview for a company that I was ultimately not morally aligned with (that would've been very stable and paid good money, too!). I am well aware that all of this sounds crazy, but it is because I worked very hard to get to where I am today. I am clarifying this because, if I had wanted to, I could have been working a full-time role for quite some time; every time I dip my toe in, I get flooded with interview requests... but I chose not to apply at all. I have enjoyed the peace of working part-time in the best job I've ever had! Also, I've been able to grow a lot as a person this past year, and gotten a much better sense of who I am and what my values are - which is hard to beat in terms of importance.</p>

    <p>I've had time to really think long and hard what I want to do with my life. And what I've realized is, I want to priotize life fulfillment, and putting good into the world. Longterm, I don't want to do work that I only enjoy, am good at, and "pays the bills." There is a 4th component that I realized is just as vital: I want to do the work that will add the most meaning and happiness to my life. I am doing some soul searching, and considering doing a 180, and devoting my career to working to better animals' lives. These are all very new thoughts, but once I ponder things some more, who knows, I might go to veterinary school and help them directly!</p>


    <p>I am also considering doing a role that meets the first 3 criteria (one that I enjoy, am good at, and "pays the bills") while doing a volunteer role that meets the 4th criteria (adding life fulfillment). I'm not sure if I'm truly cut out to be a vet, so if that's the case, I could see a fulfilling life by doing a math-related job, and volunteering with animals a couple times a week - that would be the best of both worlds!</p>

    <p>So long story short, I am once again at a crossroads in life, and I feel like there are big things on the horizon! Just still in the process of figuring out what those things are. Luckily I already have some "in-demand" skills, so if I do end up pursuing more education, at least I can also keep up my resume during college, with a role in Math Tutoring, Web Development, Fullstack Development, Software Engineering, etc. I've pondered going on to get a graduate degree in Mathematics and becoming a professor or researcher, too.</p>
    -->
    <!-- Eventually, though, I would like to make a career for myself in Web Development, Fullstack Development, or Software Engineering. Since both of my degrees focused moreso on math, I am spending the rest of my time being a sponge and learning what I need to know to obtain a full-time role in one of the above fields! To be honest, I get interviews quite frequently when applying to jobs, and have received a job offer on the spot multiple times; I probably could have landed something right out of school. However, I didn't want to bite off more than I can chew, so I prepared (and am continuously improving) by studying on my own.</p>-->

    <p>Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with others, doing my hobbies, self-studying, and overall trying to live my best life! I always have a lot going on with my aquatic animals - it's like a fish hospital in my room sometimes, except I'm the only "nurse" so it's constantly short-staffed... going for the realistic look I guess! But, trying to keep my head above water. It fills me with hope when I see new "eggnant" mama shrimp, new fish eggs in the tank, sometimes new baby snails - even just a shrimp molting successfully is a great sign! And of course, my dogs are extremely clingy, snoutsy, constantly wanting attention and walks - I love saying "yes" to those precious faces! It's so wonderful to come home and feel like a celebrity hounded by the pup-erazzi. Throughout the day, they'll even follow me room-to-room, to be up-close and snuggly! They know who loves them (hint: it's me!). I am also extremely lucky to have a best friend so close to me, who I've been friends with since before 2010! She is the kindest person I know and she is always my inspiration of what a "good" person looks like. Finally, before bed, I track my habits of the day in my spreadsheet. I like having an accountability buddy to help analyze what went wrong during the day and how to fix it. I always want to be improving and being the best version of myself!</p>

    <p>My hobbies include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Walking my two lovely <a href="photogallery/index.html" target="_blank">Doggos</a>!</li>

      <li>"Fishcare!"
        <ul>
          <li>It's overwhelming, but at least it's getting back on a schedule!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Hanging out with my friends!
        <ul>
          <li>I love talking about anything and everything, as well as laughing, enjoying the sunshine, eating, walking, swimming, or just chilling!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Music!
        <ul>
          <li>I love Singing and Piano! I also do the Kalimba.</li>
          <li>I want to learn the Ukelele and Harp.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><!--<a href="https://www.deviantart.com/chubbymarill/gallery/all"  target="_blank">Drawing</a>!-->Drawing!
        <ul>
          <li>My style is an amalgamation of cartoonish, realism, and manga!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>Dancing!
        <ul>
          <li>So far, I've dabbled in West Coast Swing, Salsa, and Just Dance!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><!--<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/171751276-miss-minky" target="_blank">Reading</a>!-->Reading!
      <ul>
        <li>I love any Nonfiction that helps me improve myself or widens my worldviews!</li>
        <li>I also brush up on Math!</li>
      </ul>

      <li>Duolingo!

      </li>

      <li>Researching stuff!
      <ul>
        <li>I need more breadth, not just depth. For example, I put in time learning about how to choose an ideal fish food in a sea of subpar options, and I enjoy reading fish food nutrition labels a little too much... or I simply over-analyze my Corydoras Catfishes' behavior. Meanwhile, I still struggle to understand how GH, KH, and Old Tank Syndrome work.</li>
        <li>I've also rediscovered Khan Academy and kind of remembering how I've only scratched the surface of learning things! It's almost like I made the <a href="resources/index.html">Resources</a> and <a href="cs/index.html">CS</a> pages in 2022 and then forgot about them for my own use... hmmmm...</li>

<h2>Introduction #2:<h2>
<h4>Quotes, followed by Life Philosophy: "The Stuff That Actually Matters"</h4>

<p><i>I do not necessarily endorse all given authors of these quotes.</i></p>

<ol>
<li><p><i>"Your character is like your health, more valuable than anything you can buy. Don't throw it away... Your character is the most precious thing about you. Don't let it degrade."</i> ~ "Ten Arguments for Deleting your Social Media Accounts Right Now"</p></li>

<li><p><i>"To my mind, the life of a lamb is no less precious than that of a human being.”</i> ~ Mahatma Gandhi</p></li>

<!--<li><p><i>"I consider myself a lover of animals and if you do too, then why would we let them go through pain and suffering?”</i> ~ Max La Manna</p></li>-->

<li><p><i>“If we can’t tell children what happens to farm animals. Maybe what we’re doing to the animals is wrong.”</i> ~ Anonymous</p></li>

<li><p><i>“There is no fundamental difference between humans and animals in their ability to feel pleasure and pain, happiness, and misery.”</i> ~ Charles Darwin</p></li>

<li><p><i>"The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love. The Lord is good to all; he has compassion on all he has made."</i> ~ Psalm 145:8-9</p></li>

<li><p><i>"My body will not be a tomb for other creatures.”</i> ~ Leonardo Da Vinci</p></li>

<li><p><i>"Don't give up. Water the seeds of your dreams, even if all you have are tears."</i> ~ Unknown</p></li>

<li><p><i>"Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.”</i> ~ Buddhaghosha (paraphrased)</p></li>

<!--<li><p><i>“Vegan is just pure love. Love for animals, love for the planet, and love for yourself.”</i> ~ Mischa Temaul</p></li>-->

<li><p><i>"Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of."</i> ~ Benjamin Franklin</p></li>

<li><p><i>"Set your mind on things above..."</i> ~ Colossians 3:2</p></li>

<li><p><i>"So in all things, do to others what you would want them to do to you."</i> ~ Matthew 7:12</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: that last one, commonly known as "The Golden Rule," not only "summarizes the law and prophets," but also summarizes my own philosophy of life. As someone with Christian roots, I remember the story of the servant who owed his master a great debt. The master chose to have mercy and forgive the servant's debt. However, the servant did not extend that same mercy; instead, he threatened a 2nd servant to repay to himself a much smaller debt.</p>

<p>Since God granted me a life free of crippling physical pain, a life free from imprisonment, a life of seeing the sunlight, I want to extend these same basic mercies to animals. That is why I want to become mostly Vegan: I have a duty to extend the same mercies that were shown to me. I could have been born a cow just as easily as I could have been born a human, after all. It is a matter of love and deep respect for life.</p>

<p>Finally, on a slightly different note, I try to remember that other people, even the ones who are full of hate and anger, are also living beings, capable of both love and pain. I'd rather the most evil people alive seek rehabilitation and self-improvement, rather than suffering and death. I don't think anyone is beyond redemption at any point in their lives. I've made mistakes in the past too, and I want to continually work to become the best version of myself that I can be. To steal some physics terms: what matters more in life than your position, is your velocity.</p>
