    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>
    <p>I am a recent Florida Tech alumnus in Applied Mathematics, with an Applied Area of Computer Science!</p>
    <p> Actually, let me start from the beginning. Here is what my loved ones and I affectionately call my "spiel":</p>

    <p>I was homeschooled, and started at Indian River State College at the ripe old age of 14. I had a perfect GPA most of my time there, and I started tutoring Calculus (among other maths) there when I was 17 (I worked in their Math Lab primarily, but also in Algebra classrooms and the Academic Support Center). I became the president of Delta Mu Epsilon (math club). Upon graduating high school, I received my AA in Mathematics, with a 3.97 GPA! Because of these things (and my SAT superscore of 1500/1600), I was placed on the 2019 All-Florida Academic Team (which is the top 0.02% of students enrolled in 2 year colleges in Florida).</p>

    <p>I was very blessed to have received merit-based, full-ride offers (100% of tuition paid) from multiple universities, including the Florida Institute of Technology, which I decided to attend. During my time there, I was involved in FITSEC (cybersecurity club), CPFIT (competitive programming club), and lightly involved in AMS (American Mathematical Society). In December 2023, I received my BS in Applied Mathematics (Applied Area: Computer Science) from FIT, with a 3.68 GPA!</p>

    <p>The Summer before I graduated, I was chosen for an internship at none other than Royal Caribbean Group! The internship's focus was using data analysis on cybersecurity trends within the organization.</p>

    <p>Now that I have my BS... I have returned to be a math tutor at IRSC! I really, really love it here. Eventually, though, I would like to make a career for myself in Web Development, Fullstack Development, or Software Engineering. Since both of my degrees focused moreso on math, I am spending the rest of my time being a sponge and learning what I need to know to obtain a full-time role in one of the above fields! To be honest, I get interviews quite frequently when applying to jobs, and have received a job offer on the spot multiple times; I probably could have landed something right out of school. However, I don't want to bite off more than I can chew, so I decided to prepare first by studying on my own (for at least the rest of 2024, maybe into 2025). Once I am satisfied with my knowledge of those fields, then I will finally be applying to full-time roles.</p>

    <p>In the (somewhat ample) mean time, I'm very glad to continue tutoring for IRSC, self-studying, and overall just living my best life! I spend my evenings doing my fun hobbies, as well as spending time with my boyfriend and my best friend. Before bed, I religiously track all of my habits of the day in my spreadsheet. With my accountability buddy I analyze what went wrong during the day and how to fix it. I always want to be improving and being the best version of myself!</p>
