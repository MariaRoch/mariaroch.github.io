    <li><strong>What is your ideal life like?</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Externally: Finding true love with someone until death, cultivating lifelong deep friendships, rescuing a bunch of doggos, and possibly having a large aquarium. I'd like a cute, comfortable house, with a multiple acre yard. I want a giant fish pond (maybe rehomed Plecos?), a giant garden (for both flowers and produce), and a spacious sunlit patio area near them, that I can gaze upon the paradise I've built (I'll call it my "Garden of Eden," haha!). That's the dream right there! I would also like to be involved in more volunteer work as well, especially with animals and the elderly.</li>

                <li>Internally: I want to be a person I'm proud of. If I were to die tomorrow in a car accident, I want to "Die with a Smile" as the song goes. I want to have healthy interpersonal relationships, and I want to be someone who is morally consistent, kind even when it's inconvenient, organized, someone who sets goals and meets them. I want to be kind to everyone, healthy in all aspects, and happy in life. I wasn't born to make money and be powerful, I was born to make the world a better place, improve others' wellbeing, and to enjoy life myself too while I'm at it.</li>

    <li><strong>What are your favorite animals and why?</strong></li>
    <ul>
    <li>Dogs -- They're loving and loyal to the very end. Truly woman's best friend!</li>
    <li>"Bottomfeeders" (Catfish, Plecos, Loaches, etc.) -- They're cute, kinda derpy, and covered in whiskers. XD</li>
    <li>Shrimp -- They're so fascinating to watch, I love how they glide in the water, have whiskers longer than their own bodies, and are kinda sassy/bossy surprisingly.</li>
    <li>Cows -- They go "Moo!" And they're cow-colored! And they play like puppies!</li>
    <li>Bunnies -- They're just so adorable.</li>
    <li>Rats/Mice -- They're cute, whisker-y, and smart!</li>
    <li>Lambs -- They're so precious!</li>
    </ul><hr>

    <li><strong>How do you feel about God?</strong></li>
    I feel that (S)he loves everyone! No matter who you are, or what you've done -- I believe God's live is infinite.<hr>

    <li><strong>What’s your philosophy in life?</strong></li>
    The Golden Rule (treat others the way you want to be treated). And also, minimize any sentient being's suffering.<hr>

    <li><strong>What habit do you have that you think not many other people have?</strong></li>
    I love organizing and tracking things! I have a spreadsheet consisting of all sorts of things (including daily goals and habits), and now I also have a website to organize things into. Despite being an extrovert, I am also very introspective and question myself, situations in life, etc. and critically analyze things. I try not to take much for granted or make assumptions! And I generally am open to expanding my views on things as well, it is a bad mindset to ever assume you couldn't be wrong about something.<hr>

    <li><strong>How would your friends describe you?</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Friend #1 said "[f]riendly, methodical, determined, intelligent, and... musical."</li>
        <li>Friend #2 said "funny, smart, warm, creative, talented, [and] quirky."</li>
        <li>Friend #3 said "[k]ind, neurotic, analytical, curious, and last but not least nice smelling."</li>
    </ul><hr>

    <li><strong>What are your values?</strong></li>
    More or less, utilitarianism towards any sentient being -- suffering should be minimized, happiness should be maximized.<hr>

    <li><strong>Is it hard for you to accept feedback?</strong></li>
    Constructive criticism is almost always welcome!<hr>

    <li><strong>What is your favorite thing about your career?</strong></li>
    As for tutoring, I love being able to learn and improve my knowledge, as well as having the satisfaction of being able to help people! I really hope to start volunteering with animals in a shelter, or in an assisted living facility! I want to be able to give back more and feel a sense of fulfillment, as well as make some new friends.<hr>

    <li><strong>Do you consider yourself a pessimist or an optimist?</strong></li>
    Interestingly enough, I was a pessimist as a kid, but then I heard that optimists are more successful, so I made a conscious effort to become an optimist! Note that I definitely don't think life is all sunshine and rainbows, I am well aware that suffering often outweighs happiness. But, I don't think that's a reason to focus on the suffering rather than the good times. Your thoughts will shape your reality, so it is worthwhile to choose good thoughts consciously.<hr>

    <li><strong>Do you believe in second chances?</strong></li>
    Absolutely! Everyone makes mistakes. Once I decide I am fond of someone, there is very little they can do that would make me want to cut contact. Even if we do lose contact for a while, I will generally reconsider later down the road anyway after a sufficient amount of time has passed. Again, once someone gets to the stage of me being fond of their presence in my life, there is not much they can do for me to ever dislike them permanently after that.<hr>

    <li><strong>What is your proudest accomplishment?</strong></li>
    Tutoring college Calculus as a 17 yr/o; getting a merit-based, 100% tuition scholarship at Florida Tech; and interning for Royal Caribbean Group! As for hobbies, I have learned some of my favorite songs on the piano, and won an art contest. Also, got on the ladder in Pokemon Showdown Gen 9 Random Doubles!<hr>

    <li><strong>What’s one of your biggest regrets in life?</strong></li>
    Not getting an additional BS (in Computer Science) at Florida Tech! Also, not getting an Associate's in Nursing while I dual-enrolled, so I could be a nurse while going to FIT.<hr>

    <li><strong>What do you like to do that most people don't like to do?</strong></li>
    I find repetitive and "boring" tasks to be quite enjoyable.<hr>

    <li><strong>What are your thoughts on death?</strong></li>
    Honestly, I'm at peace with whenever it is my time to go. Dying is part of nature and part of life. It's what makes life so special -- being alive forever would not be pretty.<hr>

    <li><strong>Are you a morning person or a night owl?</strong></li>
    I like the late afternoon when the sun shines perfectly on the world!
    <hr>

    <li><strong>What do you want to change about yourself?</strong></li>
    I wish I was naturally carefree instead of always having to make a conscious effort at it!<hr>

    <li><strong>What’s one thing that bothers you most about the world today?</strong></li>
    Most people innately want to be happy, but sadly they are sold so many fake ideas about what happiness is and how to achieve it. Also: social media.<hr>

    <li><strong>What are some of your top favorite books?</strong>
        <ul>
        <li><i>The Power of Habit</i></li>
        <li><i>Atomic Habits</i></li>

    <!--<li><strong>If you had to sit in a room and face your inner demons, what would it be like?</strong></li>
    Fear of going to a Hell I don't believe in. Acknowledging I'm not a good person. Remembering how much I suffered, thinking of how much farmed animals suffer too, and wondering if some beings' lives (including my own) are part of some cosmic joke, of seeing us lesser beings struggle and rot. Remembering how I am only alive because of the status quo; years ago I almost died, and my thought most of the time since then is "kinda wish I did die." But now, simply trying to make the most of the next 60 years of suffering. Maybe, if I get lucky, there will be less suffering than normal, and I will find moments of joy within the pains of living. Sometimes, as much as I value and respect life in its many forms, I wonder if life is really a blessing... or if life is a curse that we disillusion ourselves into thinking it's a blessing. "The creator of the ship is also the creator of the shipwreck" (FIX QUOTE, and author)... the creator of life is also the creator of murder, suicide, assault, and cancer. On an individual level, is propogating life, any species of life, a morally justifiable thing to do? I sometimes wonder if life is secretly the biggest curse of them all.-->

    <li><strong>What are some of the things that you're most thankful for?</strong></li>
    My pets, my health, my hobbies, my loved ones, and the opportunities given to me in life!<hr>
