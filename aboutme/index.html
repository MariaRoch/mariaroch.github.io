<ol>

    <li><strong>What’s your philosophy in life?</strong></li>
    The Golden Rule: treat others the way you want to be treated. And also, encourage health in all aspects of life: mental and emotional health, physical health, spiritual health, financial health, etc. There is room for improvement for everyone!<hr>

    <li><strong>What habit do you have that you think not many other people have?</strong></li>
    I love organizing and tracking things! I have a spreadsheet consisting of all sorts of things (including daily goals and habits), and now I also have a website to organize things into.<hr>

    <li><strong>How would your friends describe you?</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li>My best friend said "[f]riendly, methodical, determined, intelligent, and... musical."</li>
        <li>Friend #2 said "funny, smart, warm, creative, talented, [and] quirky."</li>
        <li>Friend #3 said "[k]ind, neurotic, analytical, curious, and last but not least nice smelling."</li>
    </ul><hr>

    <li><strong>What are your values?</strong></li>
    Hard work, building up talent, and organization should be prioritized.<hr>

    <li><strong>Is it hard for you to accept feedback?</strong></li>
    Constructive criticism is almost always welcome!<hr>

    <li><strong>What is your favorite thing about your career?</strong></li>
    As for tutoring, I love being able to learn and improve my knowledge, as well as having the satisfaction of being able to help people!
    As for the rest of my career, I am not quite sure yet what it will be, but I imagine it would be the satisfaction of turning ideas and problems into usable code.<hr>

    <li><strong>Do you consider yourself a pessimist or an optimist?</strong></li>
    Interestingly enough, I was a pessimist as a kid, but then I heard that optimists are more successful, so I made a conscious effort to become an optimist!<hr>

    <li><strong>Do you believe in second chances?</strong></li>
    Absolutely! Everyone makes mistakes. Once I decide I am fond of someone, there is very little they can do that would make me want to cut contact.<hr>

    <li><strong>What is your proudest accomplishment?</strong></li>
    Tutoring college Calculus as a minor; getting a merit-based, 100% tuition scholarship at Florida Tech; and interning for Royal Caribbean Group! As for hobbies, I have learned some of my favorite songs on the piano, won an art contest, won a beauty pageant, etc. Also, got on the ladder in Pokemon Showdown Gen 9 Random Doubles!<hr>

    <li><strong>What’s your biggest regret in life?</strong></li>
    Not getting an additional BS (in Computer Science) at Florida Tech! Also, not getting an Associate's in Nursing while I dual-enrolled, so I could be a nurse while going to FIT.<hr>

    <li><strong>What do you like to do that most people don't like to do?</strong></li>
    I find repetitive tasks to be quite enjoyable.<hr>

    <li><strong>What are your thoughts on death?</strong></li>
    Honestly, I'm at peace with whenever it is my time to go (or others'). Dying is part of nature and part of life. It's what makes life so special -- being alive forever would not be pretty.<hr>

    <li><strong>Are you a morning person or a night owl?</strong></li>
    I'm a mix between a morning person and an afternoon person.
    <hr>

    <li><strong>What do you want to change about yourself?</strong></li>
    I wish I was naturally carefree instead of always having to make a conscious effort at it. I've struggled my whole life with OCD (I'm in therapy and on meds now). I finally feel like it's under control, but I'd rather just have never had it in the first place!<hr>

    <li><strong>What’s one thing that bothers you most about the world today?</strong></li>
    Social media. It's toxic and a plague on humanity (in my opinion).<hr>

    <li><strong>What are your favorite animals and why?</strong></li>
    <ul>
    <li>Dogs -- they are loving and loyal to the end. Truly woman's best friend!</li>
    <li>Bottomfeeders (catfish, plecos, etc.) -- they are cute, covered in whiskers, and kinda dumb. XD</li>
    <li>Shrimp -- they are so fascinating to watch, I love how they glide in the water and use their long whiskers.</li>
    <li>Bunnies -- they are just so adorable.</li>
    </ul><hr>

    <li><strong>What are your top favorite books?</strong></li>
    <ul>
    <li><i>The Power of Habit</i></li>
    <li><i>Atomic Habits</i></li>
    <li><i>Happiness is the Way</i></li>
    <li><i>Deep Work</i></li>
    <li><i>Digital Minimalism</i></li>
    <li><i>The Willpower Instinct</i></li>
    <li><i>Your Fully Charged Life</i></li>
    <li>By the way, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/171751276-miss-minky?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read">here</a> is my Goodreads profile!
    </ul><hr>

    <li><strong>How do you feel about God?</strong></li>
    I feel that He loves everyone.<hr>

    <li><strong>What's on your bucket list?</strong></li>
    Getting married, having a moderately nice house with an aquarium (as well as an outdoor pond), and having a few dog children. :)
    Also, being able to manage my time impeccably. Sometimes, I'd choose having a "boring" day of being productive over a day that's meant to be exciting. I feel good about myself when I accomplish my goals.<hr>

    <li><strong>What are you most thankful for?</strong></li>
    My health, my hobbies, my loved ones, and the opportunities given to me in life!<hr>
