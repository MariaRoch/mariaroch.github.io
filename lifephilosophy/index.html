<h2>Introduction #2:<h2>
<h4>Quotes, followed by Life Philosophy: "The Stuff That Actually Matters"</h4>

<p><i>I do not necessarily endorse all given authors of these quotes.</i></p>

<ol>

</ol>

<p>Note: that last one, commonly known as "The Golden Rule," not only "summarizes the law and prophets," but also summarizes my own philosophy of life. As someone with Christian roots, I remember the story of the servant who owed his master a great debt. The master chose to have mercy and forgive the servant's debt. However, the servant did not extend that same mercy; instead, he threatened a 2nd servant to repay to himself a much smaller debt.</p>

<p>Since God granted me a life free of crippling physical pain, a life free from imprisonment, a life of seeing the sunlight, I want to extend these same basic mercies to animals. That is why I want to become mostly Vegan: I have a duty to extend the same mercies that were shown to me. I could have been born a cow just as easily as I could have been born a human, after all. It is a matter of love and deep respect for life.</p>

<p>Finally, on a slightly different note, I try to remember that other people, even the ones who are full of hate and anger, are also living beings, capable of both love and pain. I'd rather the most evil people alive seek rehabilitation and self-improvement, rather than suffering and death. I don't think anyone is beyond redemption at any point in their lives. I've made mistakes in the past too, and I want to continually work to become the best version of myself that I can be. To steal some physics terms: what matters more in life than your position, is your velocity.</p>
